# Effect of Literacy in Shelby County
## WGU D502 BSDA Capstone Project
### Hypothesis:
There is a negative correlation between literacy level in a region and the child poverty in that region. Specifically, it is hypothesized that an individual with a high school education can land a job with better earnings and can provide an above-poverty-level living for their family. 

### Context:
The Literacy Center of Shelby County wanted a report showing the correlation between education in the social and health factors affecting the countyâ€™s living conditions to promote funding for their non-profit organization. The Literacy Center chose to show the relationship between children living in poverty with the education level of the adults as one of the factors in their report. The Literacy Center believed that when donating organizations are visually shown the importance of education affecting the living standards of the County population, their chances of receiving funds would increase. With the funds to support their cause, they can continue their non-profit service to the community.  

### Data:
For the analysis of this project, I need to collect state-level data for County Health Rankings for years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.This data will be downloaded from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R), a program of the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. This is publicly available free data and can be used for educational and research purposes.
